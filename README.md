# DB theory in Lean

In this project, we focus on formalizing key results in database management theory using the Lean4 proof assistant. Our primary objective is to verify the correctness of theorems that characterize query containment under different semantics. We start by encoding foundational definitions covered in class, such as Conjunctive Queries (CQs), Set Semantics, and evaluation on an instance. We then proceed to prove the Homomorphism theorem for CQs under set semantics. Building on this, we further investigate and formalize theorems that extend beyond set semantics to a more generalized framework such as semiring semantics.
